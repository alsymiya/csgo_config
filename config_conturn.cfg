// Overwriting autoexec binds for movment-based gamemodes.

// This script supersedes some keybindings in the autoexec.cfg 
// This only works for source 1 games. Darth Elmo and I tested the external programs and they do not work. 
// You can modify the script to make the best advantage of it. Some mouse keys you might be interested are: 
// MOUSE1, MOUSE2, MOUSE3, MOUSE4, MOUSE5, MWHEELUP, MWHEELDOWN

// 0. Add connections from autoexec.cfg to this script 
// You will also need to modify some keybindings in autoexec.cfg. Here is an example: 
// CODE YOU SHOULD PUT IN YOUR AUTOEXEC.CFG BELOW. UNCOMMENT THESE COMMANDS IN YOUR SCRIPT:
// The +back here is to visually indicate yourself you are going back to autoexec. You can remove it if you think it is unnecessary. 
// alias customSurfExec "exec config_surf_conturn";
// bind "PGDN" "+back;customSurfExec;"; 


// 1. Return to autoexec keybindings with one keypress
// This echo message should pop up in your console when you wish to go back to autoexec. So it is also removable. 
alias customMessageConturnOff "say conturn is now off"; 
alias echoAutoExec   "echo AutoExec Scripts Loaded [X] ";
alias backToAutoExec "exec autoexec.cfg; echoAutoExec"; 
bind "PGUP" "+forward;conturn_off;backToAutoExec;customMessageConturnOff"; // turn off conturn and go back to autoexec script

// 2. Activate conturn: 
// If you do something like me, you may need to press PGDN/PGUP twice to get the corresponding binds. 
// This is another way to visually indicate yourself the bindings are successful. 
alias customExecConturn "exec conturn";
alias customMessageConturnOn "say conturn is now running"; 
bind "PGDN" "+back;customExecConturn;customMessageConturnOn"; 

// 3. Keybindings with Conturn 
// These will work only if you are running conturn. 
// Notice that -left and -right are here (not -_left/-_right because they do not exist). 
// Turns usually pair with the movement key. So binding two movements together does not hurt. You can still press two keys for strafing if you want. 
alias +surf_leftTurn "+_left;";
alias +surf_rightTurn "+_right;";
alias -surf_leftTurn "-_left;";
alias -surf_rightTurn "-_right;";
alias +surf_leftTurnAlt "+_left;+moveleft";
alias +surf_rightTurnAlt "+_right;+moveright";
alias -surf_leftTurnAlt "-_left;-moveleft";
alias -surf_rightTurnAlt "-_right;-moveright";


// 4. Turn speed changing methods 
// You can choose multiple ways to bind these things: 
// The default _cl_yawspeed when conturn is on is 90. I change it to 210 just to make it feel like cssource/csgo
// Sometimes I prefer to use my thumb to do the job so I also bind v and b key. 
_cl_yawspeed 210;
_cl_yawspeed; 
bind Q +surf_leftTurn;
bind E +surf_rightTurn;
//bind V +surf_leftTurn;
//bind B +surf_rightTurn;

// Method 1. you can use the toggle command like this to change the _cl_yawspeed. 
// Changing a convar will have no effect until conturn is notified of the new value. 
// You do that by simply writing the variable name to print its value after each time you change it. See example below. VSCode may give it an incorrect color 
// bind <key> "toggle _cl_yawspeed <values>; _cl_yawspeed"; 
// Example use: 
// bind 1 "toggle _cl_yawspeed 30 210 350; _cl_yawspeed";

// Method 2. set the to the specific values with or without a key press: 
// Without keypress, for example: 
// bind <key1> "_cl_yawspeed 30; _cl_yawspeed"; 
// bind <key2> "_cl_yawspeed 210; _cl_yawspeed"; 
// Example use below. You should use autoexec keybindings to rebind these two keys. 
// bind 1 "_cl_yawspeed 30; _cl_yawspeed"; 
// bind 2 "_cl_yawspeed 210; _cl_yawspeed"; 

// Method 3. set the value for each different turnbinding keys 
// For very fast left turns I tend to use an alternative key. This is what I use recently. 
alias +surf_leftTurnAlt2 "_cl_yawspeed 30; _cl_yawspeed;+_left;+moveleft";
alias +surf_rightTurnAlt2 "_cl_yawspeed 30; _cl_yawspeed;+_right;+moveright";
alias -surf_leftTurnAlt2 "-_left;-moveleft";
alias -surf_rightTurnAlt2 "-_right;-moveright";
alias +surf_leftTurnAlt3 "_cl_yawspeed 280; _cl_yawspeed;+_left;+moveleft";
alias +surf_rightTurnAlt3 "_cl_yawspeed 280; _cl_yawspeed;+_right;+moveright";
alias -surf_leftTurnAlt3 "-_left;-moveleft";
alias -surf_rightTurnAlt3 "-_right;-moveright";
bind Q +surf_leftTurnAlt2;
bind E +surf_rightTurnAlt2;
bind V +surf_leftTurnAlt3;
bind B +surf_rightTurnAlt3; 

// 5. +speed key 
// +speed in CSGO actually lowers your speed (by default it is the left shift key, and you "walk" when pressing it) 
// +speed SCALES DOWN acceleration, meaning you will lose speed faster. But it is the only official method to lower the yawspeed (210 -> 140)
// conturn introduces +_speed which only scales the angle speed. Conturn set this to 0.33 by default. But for the classic CSGO feeling it should be 0.66
// If you do not find it useful you can jsut comment it out. 
_cl_anglespeedkey 0.66; 
_cl_yawspeed;
bind shift +_speed;


// 6. Nulls 
// This will immediately disable the opposite movement that was inputted before the new input 
// Some say this will help in rampstrafes. But some good players say they do not need it. Comment them out if you feel like.
